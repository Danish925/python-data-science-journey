python-data-science-journey

A beginner-friendly journey into Python for data science. This repository documents my learning path with hands‑on scripts, mini‑projects, and Jupyter Notebooks—covering Python basics, data handling, and visualization on the path to full data science proficiency.

Highlights

10+ mini Python projects focused on clean functions, input validation, and small CLIs.

Practice across control flow, loops, randomness, error handling, and basic file I/O.

Roadmap-aligned learning: foundations now → persistence and OOP → pandas, NumPy, and visualization.

How to run

Requirements: Python 3.10+.

Clone:

git clone https://github.com/Danish925/python-data-science-journey

cd python-data-science-journey

Run any script:

Password Generator: python password_generator.py

Quiz Game: python quiz_game.py

Dice Roller: python dice_roller.py

Countdown Timer: python countdown_timer.py

Tip (Windows): if python is not found, use py instead (e.g., py password_generator.py).

My Projects

Simple Calculator
A basic calculator to practice fundamental programming concepts—add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

User Profile Creator
Takes user input to create a basic profile, demonstrating console I/O and string handling.

Rock, Paper, Scissors
Practices if/elif/else logic and Python’s random module to create a simple opponent.

Mad Libs Generator
Handles multiple user inputs and uses f‑strings for formatted output.

Number Guessing Game
Demonstrates while loops, conditional logic, and try/except for robust error handling.

Dice Rolling Simulator
Simulates a six‑sided die; reinforces randomness and a clean replay loop.

Simple Quiz Game
Asks questions, tracks score, and provides feedback—good practice in loops and state.

Powerful Password Generator
Generates secure passwords with configurable length and character sets; includes input validation.

Simple Countdown Timer
Counts down from a user‑specified time; practices input checks, time.sleep, and mm:ss formatting.

Roadmap (next steps)

File I/O and persistence (upgrade To‑Do app to save/load data cleanly).

OOP refactor (Task/ToDoList classes, JSON persistence, tests).

Analytics toolkit: pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn with EDA notebooks.

Repo info

Pinned on my GitHub profile for easy access.

Releases will be tagged per milestone (e.g., v0.2.0 “Persistence”, v0.3.0 “OOP Refactor”).
