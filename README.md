# python-data-science-journey
A beginner-friendly journey into Python for data science. This repository documents my learning path with hands-on scripts, mini-projects, and Jupyter Notebooks, covering Python basics, data handling, and visualizationâ€”step by step toward mastering data science and AI skills.


## My Projects

### 1. Simple Calculator
A basic calculator I built with Python to practice fundamental programming concepts. It can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

### 2. User Profile Creator
A simple script that takes user input to create a basic profile, demonstrating I/O and string handling.
