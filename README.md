# python-data-science-journey
A beginner-friendly journey into Python for data science. This repository documents my learning path with hands-on scripts, mini-projects, and Jupyter Notebooks, covering Python basics, data handling, and visualizationâ€”step by step toward mastering data science and AI skills.


### My Projects ###

### 1. Simple Calculator
A basic calculator I built with Python to practice fundamental programming concepts. It can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

### 2. User Profile Creator
A simple script that takes user input to create a basic profile, demonstrating I/O and string handling.

### 3. Rock, Paper, Scissors
A classic game built to practice `if/elif/else` conditions and using Python's `random` module to create a simple AI opponent.

### 4. Mad Libs Generator
A classic word game to practice handling multiple user inputs and advanced string formatting with f-strings.

### 5. Number Guessing Game
A game that demonstrates the use of `while` loops, `if/elif/else` conditional logic, and `try/except` for robust error handling. The player guesses a number and the program provides feedback.

### 6. Dice Rolling Simulator
A fun script that simulates rolling a six-sided die. This project reinforces the use of `while` loops to create a continuous user experience and the `random` module for generating unpredictable outcomes.

### 7. Simple Quiz Game
A basic quiz application that asks a series of questions and tracks the user's score. This project is a great exercise in using `if/else` statements to evaluate user input and variables to manage the game's state.

### 8. Powerful Password Generator
A tool that generates secure, random passwords based on user-specified criteria like length and character types. This project demonstrates the use of functions to organize code into logical, reusable blocks and showcases handling user input with robust error checking.

### 9. Simple Countdown Timer
A useful command-line tool that counts down from a user-specified time in seconds. This project was built to reinforce core skills in handling user input with error checking, using `while` loops, and working with Python's built-in `time` module.
