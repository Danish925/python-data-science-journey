python-data-science-journey
A beginner-friendly, hands-on journey into Python for data science. This repository documents practical learning through mini-projects, scripts, and Jupyter Notebooks—gradually building a strong foundation in Python programming and data science essentials.

Highlights
10+ mini Python projects emphasizing clean code, input validation, and interactive CLI tools.

Comprehensive practice across control flow, loops, randomness, error handling, and file I/O.

Progressive roadmap from basic Python concepts to persistence, OOP, and data visualization with pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Recently added: A To-Do CLI app featuring human-readable persistent storage with [ ] / [x] format.

Selected Projects Overview
Powerful Password Generator: Configurable secure passwords with robust input checks.

Simple Quiz Game: Interactive Q&A with feedback and score tracking.

Dice Rolling Simulator: Randomness exploration with replay capabilities.

Number Guessing Game: Loop and try/except handling for input robustness.

Simple Countdown Timer: User input validation, timing, and display formatting.

To-Do CLI (TXT Persistence):

Add, view, mark complete/incomplete, edit, delete tasks.

Clear completed tasks with ease.

Undo last action with snapshot history.

Saves tasks to tasks.txt in a readable, cross-platform safe format.

Getting Started
Requirements: Python 3.10 or higher is recommended.

Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Danish925/python-data-science-journey
cd python-data-science-journey
Running your favorite projects:

bash
python password_generator.py
python quiz_game.py
python dice_roller.py
python countdown_timer.py
python tasks.py        # To-Do CLI application
Note: Windows users might need to use py instead of python if the former is not recognized.

To-Do CLI Application Details
File: tasks.py

Features:

Add, list, mark tasks complete/incomplete.

Edit and delete tasks.

Clear all completed tasks with one command.

Search and filter tasks by keyword and status.

Undo last change for simple error recovery.

Persistence: Saves tasks in a UTF-8 encoded text file (tasks.txt) with clear [ ] or [x] status markers.

Blank and malformed lines are safely ignored to ensure data robustness.

What’s Next in the Learning Roadmap
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Refactor projects using classes and inheritance.

JSON Persistence and Automated Testing.

Advanced Data Analytics: pandas, NumPy, and visualization projects.

More complex data science mini-projects and explorations.

This repo is pinned on my GitHub profile for easy access as a personal coding portfolio and learning reference.

Feel free to explore, run the projects, and contribute if you want to! Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
