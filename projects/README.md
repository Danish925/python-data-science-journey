# Python Projects (OOP)

This folder contains various standalone projects built in Python, with a strong focus on applying **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

* **`password-generator-oop`**: A project that generates secure, random passwords. It is structured using OOP principles to manage password criteria (length, character types, etc.) and generation logic.

* **`todo-cli-oop-json`**: A command-line interface (CLI) to-do list application. This project uses OOP to define `Task` and `TaskList` objects and leverages JSON for persistent storage (saving and loading tasks).

* **`zoo-sim-oop`**: A zoo simulation game. This project uses OOP to create classes for different `Animals`, `Habitats`, and perhaps `ZooKeeper` staff, managing interactions and states like hunger or stats.
