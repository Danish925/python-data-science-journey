# Data Analysis and Visualization Journey

This repository contains a collection of projects focused on mastering data analysis with Pandas and data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn, using the Titanic dataset as a primary case study.

The repository is organized into two main learning modules:

1.  **`pandas_learning_with_titanic_data`**: Scripts focused on data cleaning, processing, feature engineering, and analysis.
2.  **`matplotlib_&_seaborn_learning_with_titanic_data`**: Scripts focused on creating a wide variety of static and interactive plots.

## üìÅ pandas_learning_with_titanic_data

This folder contains a step-by-step guide to data wrangling and analysis using `pandas`. The scripts are numbered to follow a logical learning path, from basics to advanced pipelines.

### Scripts
* `01_pandas_basics.py` / `.ipynb`: Foundational script for loading data and performing initial inspections.
* `02_titanic_loading_and_inspection.py`: Detailed data loading and initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* `03_column_selection_and_filtering.py`: Demonstrates selecting columns and filtering data based on conditions.
* `04_missing_data_and_simple_features.py`: Handles missing values and creates simple features.
* `05_groupby_deep_dive.py`: Explores advanced `groupby` techniques to aggregate data.
* `06_pure_pandas_advanced_missing_values_strategies.py`: Implements sophisticated missing value imputation methods.
* `07_pure_pandas_datatype_optimization.py`: Focuses on optimizing data types for memory efficiency.
* `08_pure_pandas_string_processing_and_feature_engineering.py`: Advanced string manipulation and feature engineering.
* `09_pure_pandas_outlier_detection.py`: Contains scripts for identifying and handling outliers.
* `10_complete_pandas_pipeline_integration.py`: Integrates all previous steps into a single, reusable pipeline.

## üìä matplotlib_&_seaborn_learning_with_titanic_data

This folder contains scripts for creating visualizations. It starts with `matplotlib` basics and progresses to more complex plots, styling, and integrating `pandas` data.

### Scripts
* `01_Matplotlib_basics_&_first_plots.py`: Introduction to `matplotlib`, creating basic plots like line, bar, and scatter.
* `02_Plot_types_&_customization.py`: Exploring different plot types (histograms, pie charts) and how to customize them (colors, labels, titles).
* `03_Subplots_&_figure_management.py`: Learning to create and manage multiple plots within a single figure.
* `04_Data_integration_(pandas+matplotlib).py`: Directly plotting data from `pandas` DataFrames.
* `05_Professional_styling_&_export.py`: Applying professional styles, themes, and exporting high-quality figures.
* `untitled.ipynb`: A scratchpad for testing new plot ideas.

## üíæ Datasets

The following datasets are used across the projects:
* `titanic_data.csv`: A classic dataset used throughout the projects.
* `detailed_groupby.csv`: A custom dataset for practicing advanced grouping.
* `survival_analysis.csv`: A dataset for survival-related visualizations.
* `titanic_minimal_clean.csv`: A cleaned and simplified version.
* `titanic_smart_filled.csv`: A version with intelligently imputed values.
* `titanic_with_features.csv`: A feature-rich version ready for analysis.
