# Data Visualization
This folder contains scripts and resources for data visualization projects, focusing on creating informative and aesthetically pleasing plots to explore datasets and communicate key insights. The goal is to master various visualization techniques, moving from basic plotting to advanced, multi-dimensional representations.

## Project Structure
The folder is organized to guide you through a structured learning path:

* `01_pandas_basics.py`: Foundational script for loading data and performing initial inspections.
* `02_titanic_loading_and_inspection.py`: Detailed data loading and initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the Titanic dataset.
* `03_column_selection_and_filtering.py`: Scripts demonstrating how to select specific columns and filter data based on conditions, a crucial step before plotting.
* `04_missing_data_and_simple_features.py`: Handles missing values and creates simple features to prepare the data for visualization.
* `05_groupby_deep_dive.py`: Explores advanced `groupby` techniques to aggregate data, which is essential for creating summary plots.
* `06_pure_pandas_advanced_missing_values_strategies.py`: Implements sophisticated missing value imputation methods, like group-based imputation, to improve data quality for visualization.
* `07_pure_pandas_datatype_optimization.py`: Focuses on optimizing data types for memory efficiency and faster processing, leading to smoother visualization performance.
* `08_pure_pandas_string_processing_and_feature_engineering.py`: Demonstrates advanced string manipulation and feature engineering to derive new variables from text data.
* `09_pure_pandas_outlier_detection.py`: Contains scripts for identifying and handling outliers using various statistical methods.
* `10_complete_pandas_pipeline_integration.py`: Integrates all previous data cleaning and preprocessing steps into a single, reusable pipeline for production-level work.

## Datasets
The following datasets are included in this folder:
* `titanic_data.csv`: A classic dataset used throughout the projects to analyze survival patterns.
* `detailed_groupby.csv`: A custom dataset for practicing advanced grouping operations.
* `survival_analysis.csv`: A dataset specifically for survival-related visualizations.
* `titanic_minimal_clean.csv`: A cleaned and simplified version of the Titanic dataset for quick visualizations.
* `titanic_smart_filled.csv`: A version of the Titanic dataset with intelligently imputed values.
* `titanic_with_features.csv`: A feature-rich version of the Titanic dataset, ready for advanced analysis.

## Key Learnings
This project series aims to teach you how to:
* **Prepare data for visualization**: Master cleaning, feature engineering, and data wrangling techniques.
* **Select the right plots**: Understand which types of visualizations best represent different data types and relationships.
* **Tell a story with data**: Create a narrative that guides viewers through your insights.
* **Build a scalable workflow**: Design a robust data processing pipeline that can be easily applied to new projects.

Feel free to explore the scripts and adapt them for your own projects!
